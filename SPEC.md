## 1. Executive Summary

### Project Overview

Refresh and update [5dmemorycrystal.com](https://www.5dmemorycrystal.com) to:
- Position 5D Memory Crystal as a **high-end luxury product** — lux, high-end tech, cutting edge but not a fad
- Appeal to both **B2C** (individuals who can spend $3K-$25K+) and **B2B** (luxury brands — cars, watches, fashion, jewellery, yachts)
- Maintain existing SEO traction while dramatically elevating visual execution
- Drive B2C traffic to the quiz funnel at `memory-quiz.5dmemorycrystal.com`
- Create dedicated B2B content for luxury partnerships with strong **B2B2C opportunity**

### Key Principle

> **Each successful B2B case must be documented as a separate page/topic for SEO and GEO optimization.**

### Related Properties

| Property | Purpose | Tech Stack |
|----------|---------|------------|
| 5dmemorycrystal.com | Consumer/B2B brand site | TBD (this project) |
| memory-quiz.5dmemorycrystal.com | B2C conversion funnel | Next.js / Cloud Run |
| sphotonix.com | Corporate/investor site | Separate |

### Site Relationship

- **5dmemorycrystal.com** = Consumer brand (must appeal for leads and conversions)
- **sphotonix.com** = Corporate/investor site (business, corporate, Advanced Optics, licensing, B2B data storage, space, digital preservation, R&D, government, DNA)
- Show relationship to SPhotonix but 100% focused on getting leads and conversions
- Footer: "A SPhotonix company"

## 5. Branding & Visual Identity

### Brand Personality

> **"Lux, high-end tech, cutting edge but not a fad."**

Think Leica meets Apple. Confident, understated, substantive. Craftsmanship you can feel.

### Brand Attributes

- Premium, not flashy
- Technological sophistication with emotional warmth
- Heritage and innovation combined
- Exclusivity without elitism
- **Legacy** and **exclusive** are key themes

### Brand Guidelines

**Reference:** [SPhotonix Figma Brand Assets](https://www.figma.com/design/Te4ed6eIvhPBYUqHDNHJi7/SPhotonix_Denys?node-id=89-94&t=835H5hUTsaNXOBWo-1)

**Important Notes from Caroline:**
- Current SPhotonix brand is more business/corporate (useful for Advanced Optics, licensing, B2B data storage, space, digital preservation, R&D, government, DNA)
- 5D Memory Crystal must show relationship to SPhotonix BUT must 100% appeal to get leads and conversions
- Andrii has freedom to evolve within premium direction while maintaining brand connection

### Visual References (Admired)

| Brand | What We Like |
|-------|--------------|
| leica.com | Product photography, heritage storytelling |
| apple.com | Simplicity, scroll experience, product reveal |
| patek.com | Timelessness, generational messaging |
| rimowa.com | Modern luxury, clean layouts |
| arc'teryx.com | Technical + premium feel |

### What to AVOID

- ❌ Generic Webflow/Squarespace templates
- ❌ Startup landing page aesthetic
- ❌ Heavy stock photography
- ❌ "Web3/crypto" visual language
- ❌ Excessive animations
- ❌ Busy e-commerce layouts
- ❌ Anything that feels like a fad

### Photography Requirements

| Type | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Product shots | Exists | Some crystal photography available |
| Lifestyle | Needed | Crystal in luxury settings (cars, yachts, jewellery) |
| Detail/Macro | Needed | Close-up of crystal structure, colors under light |
| Packaging | Needed | Unboxing experience, premium cases |

### Video Requirements

| Type | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Product videos | Exists | Some available |
| Hero brand video | Needed | 60s emotional brand story |
| How it works | Needed | Explainer video |
| Testimonials | Needed | Customer stories + Boucheron B2B |

### Visual Hero Strategy

**Both product AND emotional outcome, sequenced:**
1. Lead with emotional outcome (legacy, exclusivity, memories)
2. Reveal product as the solution
3. Product is beautiful but it's about what's inside

---

## 6. Content & Messaging

### Core Message

> **Focus on LEGACY and EXCLUSIVITY**

Caroline's feedback: "Legacy is big, as well as exclusive"

**Primary messaging themes:**
- Legacy — your memories preserved for generations
- Exclusivity — cutting edge technology, limited, premium
- Permanence — 1,000+ years

**Tagline options to explore:**
- "Legacy, crystallized"
- "A thousand years of you"
- "Memories that outlast time"

### Content Depth Strategy

| Page | Technical Depth | Tone |
|------|-----------------|------|
| Homepage | Light | Emotional + benefit-focused (legacy, exclusive) |
| Technology | Deep | Scientific credibility |
| B2C Product | Medium | Features + emotional outcomes |
| B2B | Medium-Deep | ROI, durability, specifications, B2B2C opportunity |

### Common Objections to Address

| Objection | Response Strategy |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "Why $3K for just 1GB?" | It's not about storage size—it's about permanence. Your great-grandchildren will access this. |
| "Will SPhotonix exist in 100 years?" | The crystal doesn't need us to. It's self-contained, readable with standard optical equipment. |
| "Who needs 1000 years?" | Frame as generational: your great-great-grandchildren. Show multi-generational family imagery. |

### Trust Signals (Priority Order)

### Blog Strategy
